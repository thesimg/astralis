    </h3>
    <p>
      <br />
      Use WASD or the arrow keys to move around the world
      <br /><br />
      Press SHIFT to dash in the direction you are moving
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
      You can stick to any side of a platform
      <br /><br />
      Platforms that have the [!] symbol will vanish after you jump off of them
      <br /><br />
      Platforms that have the [~] symbol are broken and have a limited lifespan
      <br /><br />
      Normal platforms have no symbol
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
      <strong>FODDIAN GAMEMODES</strong><br />
      have no normal platforms, ascend the map as fast as you can, faster dash
      cooldown
      <br /><br />
      The normal Foddian gamemode (top portal) is tall, wide, and fairly easy
      map
      <br /><br />
      The Foddian Lite gamemode (left portal) is a smaller, wider, and faster
      map
      <br /><br />
      The Foddian Extreme gamemode (right portal) is a taller, thinner, and more
      challenging map
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
      <strong>TRAVERSAL GAMEMODES [DISABLED]</strong><br />
      has a mix of all platforms, traverse the map to the east as fast as you
      can
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
      You may enter a specific seed into the "seed" input, so you can compete
      against your friends on a specific map
      <br /><br />
      Press [R] to restart the level
      <br /><br />
      Press [C] to copy the link to that level to share with people
